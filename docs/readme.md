# Community Patch
The Community Patch is a DLL mod for Age of Empires II: The Conquerors and UserPatch 1.5. The primary purpose is to add more modding functionality.

Unlike UserPatch 1.5, this patch is **not** intended for end users. Instead, it should be used by mod developers.

## Modding features
For an overview of the new modding features, see [modding-features.md](./modding-features.md).

## File formats
The Community Patch stores more data in files like scenarios and recorded games, so they can be analyzed in more detail by third-party parsers. See [file-formats.md](./file-formats.md) for an overview.

## Fixes
- Scrolling no longer gets stuck when playing on Linux/Wine.
- The scenario editor no longer displays pierce armour as bonus range.

## Features
- The number of idle villagers is shown on top of the Idle Villager button.
